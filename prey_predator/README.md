# systme design for the system

1. State Space:
   - Each state is represented by four numbers (MP, FP, MR, FR)
   - MP = Male Predators
   - FP = Female Predators
   - MR = Male Prey
   - FR = Female Prey

2. Transition Types and Rates:

   a- Prey Reproduction (λ₁):
   - Occurs when male and female prey meet
   - Rate proportional to MR × FR (interaction term)
   - Results in 1-5 new prey (random mix of M/F)
   - State change: (MP, FP, MR+k₁, FR+k₂) where k₁+k₂ ≤ 5

   b- Predator Reproduction (λ₂):
   - Occurs when male and female predators meet
   - Rate proportional to MP × FP
   - Results in 1-5 new predators (random mix of M/F)
   - State change: (MP+k₁, FP+k₂, MR, FR) where k₁+k₂ ≤ 5

   c- Predation (λ₃):
   - Rate proportional to total predator × total prey population
   - Probability p of successful kill
   - State change: (MP, FP, MR-1, FR) or (MP, FP, MR, FR-1)

   d- Natural Death:
   - Prey death rate μ₁
   - Predator death rate μ₂
   - Applied to each individual independently

3. Prey Competition (when prey population exceeds threshold K₁):

Triggered when total prey (MR + FR) > K₁
Modifies the prey death rate using formula:

μ₁_new = μ₁(1 + α((MR+FR)/K₁ - 1))
Where α is the competition coefficient


This means death rate increases proportionally to how much the population exceeds the threshold


4. Predator Competition (when prey/predator ratio below threshold K₂):

Triggered when (MR+FR)/(MP+FP) < K₂
Modifies the predator death rate using formula:

μ₂_new = μ₂(1 + β(K₂/(MR+FR)/(MP+FP)))
Where β is the predator competition coefficient


Death rate increases as the prey/predator ratio gets smaller


# assumptions to make sure of the markovian state

For this predator-prey model to be Markovian, we need several key assumptions. Let me break them down:

1. Memoryless Property:
   - Future transitions must depend only on current state (MP, FP, MR, FR)
   - No dependence on past population sizes
   - No "memory" of previous interactions between individuals
   - Ages of individuals cannot affect rates (unless explicitly tracked in state)

2. Independent Transitions:
   - Each type of event (birth, death, predation) must occur independently
   - No coordinated behaviors between individuals beyond simple rate-based interactions
   - Multiple events cannot occur simultaneously (in continuous time model)

3. Exponential Interevent Times:
   - Time between events must follow exponential distribution
   - This is crucial for continuous-time Markov property
   - Implies constant transition rates when in a given state

4. Population Homogeneity:
   - All males of same species are identical
   - All females of same species are identical
   - No individual variations in:
     * Reproduction capability
     * Survival ability
     * Hunting/escaping skills

5. State-Based Rates:
   - All rates (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃, μ₁, μ₂) must depend only on current population counts
   - Competition effects must be instantaneous functions of current state
   - No time delays in competition effects

6. Spatial Homogeneity:
   - No spatial structure or territory effects
   - All individuals have equal probability of interacting
   - Perfect mixing of populations

7. Environment Stability:
   - Parameters remain constant over time
   - No seasonal or environmental variations
   - No external influences beyond those captured in state variables
